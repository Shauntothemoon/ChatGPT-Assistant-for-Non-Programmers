# ChatGPT-Assistant-for-Non-Programmers


As someone with no background in computer science or programming experience, I spent over an hour creating a user-friendly GPT assistant that can be easily used by people with almost no programming experience. (Prompts in the screenshot)

Inspired by this author's ideas (https://pinchlime.com/newsletters/my-six-chatgpt-assistants/), it can provide different types of services, such as summarizing a long piece of text, generating related sub-issues around a topic, and helping you think critically about a topic.

In the code, I have also left clear positions where you can easily edit the type of assistant you want and the model type (if you want others). All you need to do is replace the text.

To use it, all you need to do is:

1. Download the file below, register an account on the OpenAI website (https://platform.openai.com/overview), generate an API key for yourself, and then use any IDE (the software used to write programs, even Notepad will do) to replace the third line of the code ("Your API Key Here", the part in quotation marks).
2. Type `pip install openai` in the terminal and press enter to run it.
3. Run this file in the terminal using `python gpt_api_caller.py` (Make sure you are in the correct directory!).

If these three steps are still unclear to you, you can easily find out how to do it on Google or... ChatGPT! ;)
